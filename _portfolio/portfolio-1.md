<p>
        The Flight Delay Prediction App is an interactive web-based application designed to predict flight arrival delays based on various input parameters. This tool uses machine learning, specifically Linear Regression, to provide users with accurate predictions, enhancing their ability to manage travel plans effectively.

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Upon accessing the application, users are greeted with a clean and intuitive interface. They can easily navigate through different sections, making it straightforward to use.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Upload:</strong> Users can upload a CSV file containing historical flight data. The required format includes essential information such as airline codes, origin and destination airport codes, departure delays, taxi-out times, flight distances, and the corresponding arrival delays.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Model Training:</strong> After uploading the data, users can click the "Train Model" button. This action triggers the app to train a Linear Regression model on the uploaded dataset, effectively learning from the provided historical data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Input Flight Details:</strong> Once the model is trained, users can fill out specific input fields with flight details, including the airline, origin, destination, departure delay, and other relevant factors.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Predicting Delays:</strong> After entering the flight information, users simply click the "Predict Delay" button. The app utilizes the trained model to analyze the input data and provides a predicted arrival delay, helping users anticipate any potential delays.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> The app aims to integrate more advanced machine learning models in future versions, allowing for better prediction accuracy and enhanced user experience.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This app is particularly beneficial for airlines looking to optimize their flight schedules, as well as for travelers wanting to stay informed about their flight status.
