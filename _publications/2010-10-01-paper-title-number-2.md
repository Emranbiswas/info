excerpt: "Bike Sharing Systems (BSS) are becoming morepopular since they are more space-efficient in crowded citiesand promote physical fitness. By not emitting any greenhousegases. Also protects the environment by not producing CO2. InBSS, the system operators generally distribute bikes amongstations by driving trucks according to their gut instinct.However, this method may not always be accurate whichresults in unnecessary relocation of bikes and increasesexpenses. So, accurately predicting future rental demand ateach station is crucial for both bike-sharing operators andusers. In this paper, we investigated how various contextualinformation can help to predict bike rental demand in thefollowing days. Due to various mathematical properties ofmachine learning algorithms, the collected contextualinformation may provide different predictions accuracy.Therefore, we studied four different modeling approaches:Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Random Forestand Category Boosting, and Long-Short Term Memory. Bymeasuring the modelâ€™s correctness of prediction, it isdetermined that CatBoost is the best-performing modelcompared to others for one day rental demand prediction. Butfor more than the one-day prediction, LSTM performs better.Moreover, we found that contextual information such asgeography has a significant impact on the model prediction."
